# Mode of work:
1. During the Thursday lab we discuss this week’s milestones and how we will tackle them. We organize our responsibilities and work from 2PM to 8 PM.
2. If we do not manage to finish our work on Thursday, we will meet online through a Slack huddle on Friday from 2PM to 6PM.
3. Before submission, we must perform a review of our deliverables and provide feedback and make fixes and improvements wherever necessary.
4. We will accompany each pull request with a detailed explanation of what it includes.
5. We will maintain local backups of our work to revert to in case something goes wrong with our repo.
6. We will send a slack message whenever we push something to the repo.
7. We will maintain a dynamic mindset and working style and be open to making changes to this document as long as the majority of the team approves it.
8. We will resolve conflicts through voting and break ties via a FT3 rock paper scissors game between a representative of each voting party.
